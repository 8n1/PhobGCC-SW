# PhobGCC
Gamecube controller motherboard using a teensy as the microcontroller. Aim is to make an accessible and consistent controller. Has the option of using hall effect sensors instead of potentiometers, stick calibration, snapback filtering, emulated PODE. Early stages, I do not recommend trying to make one yet.
